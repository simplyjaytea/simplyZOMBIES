# Handoff

State of the project for whoever picks it up next — a person or a fresh session. Written 2026-08-05,
updated 2026-08-06 when the noise spine landed.

**Read this, then [README.md](README.md), then [TODO.md](TODO.md).**

## Where things stand

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | **Milestone 1, phase 1 done: the noise spine.** There is now a game. Shout, and the district walks toward you. |
| **Merged** | [PR #1](https://github.com/simplyjaytea/simplyZOMBIES/pull/1) — the design docs · [PR #2](https://github.com/simplyjaytea/simplyZOMBIES/pull/2) — the attention spike · [PR #3](https://github.com/simplyjaytea/simplyZOMBIES/pull/3) — all of Milestone 0 |
| **In flight** | the noise spine: attention field, shamblers, shout, debug overlay, and a GitHub Pages deploy |
| **Next real work** | **Scent** — and the two checkpoints riding on it. See [Do this next](#do-this-next). |

## The build

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on every green CI run on `main`.

> ⚠ **One manual step is still outstanding:** Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**. Until
> someone with repo admin does that, the workflow runs and the deploy step fails. Nothing in CI
> depends on it.

The build is worth playing now, which is the whole reason it exists. What it cannot answer is in
[Open questions](#open-questions-nobody-has-answered), and the first one needs a human at a keyboard.

## What's in the repo

```
docs/           27 design documents. The README index is the reading-order authority,
                not the file numbers — 24-26 were written last but belong under "The world".
TODO.md         The backlog through Milestone 2, with all 8 roadmap risks pinned to the
                task that answers each one. Milestone 0 and the noise spine are ticked.
src/sim/        The simulation. Pure, headless, deterministic — kernel, modules, rng.
src/sim/field/  The attention field. Kernel, not a module (see below).
src/render/     Canvas renderer. Reads the sim, never writes to it.
src/platform/   The host: input, the tick loop, storage, content loading, schemas.
content/        JSON content plus its JSON Schemas.
test/           Unit and integration, including determinism and module isolation.
bench/          The performance budgets. They fail the build.
```

The spike is **gone** — deleted in the same change that ported its findings onto the real kernel,
exactly as the previous handoff said it could be. `docs/23-roadmap.md` keeps the evidence.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # the game at http://127.0.0.1:5174
npm test                 # correctness: 156 tests
npm run typecheck        # two projects — see the sim/ purity gate below
npm run lint
npm run bench            # tick budgets
npm run bench:frame      # frame budget, drives real Chromium
```

In the browser: `WASD` move · `Shift` sprint · **`Space` shout** · **`O` attention overlay** ·
`P` pause · `F5` save · `F9` load.

**Press space.** That is the whole milestone: 4,055 of the district's 4,096 field cells go live, 298
of 300 shamblers switch to seeking, and over the next minute the crowd within 50 m goes from about 30
bodies to about 90. Then it fades and they drift off again.

The HUD shows live field cells, the horde's state counts, and a **state fingerprint** — that string is
what the determinism test compares.

If Playwright can't find a browser, point it at one: `CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chromium npm run
bench:frame`.

## Settled decisions: do not relitigate

These were each decided explicitly by the repo owner. If you're about to "improve" one, don't:

- **Hardcore is the thesis, not a difficulty slider.** Permadeath with succession into another
  survivor; no win condition plus an optional expensive escape.
- **No wave timer.** Horde pacing is attention-driven and director-paced.
- **Blank slates, no classes.** The build lives in found gear (PoE-shaped affixes) plus a classless
  skill web earned by doing. Applies to every survivor, not just the player.
- **Survivors are unlimited and procedurally generated.** Recruits arrive as unskilled nobodies — that
  is the counterweight that keeps permadeath meaningful.
- **Melee and ranged both good**, spending non-convertible currencies (body/bite-risk vs.
  ammo/attention).
- **Fully drivable continuous region**, no abstracted travel legs. **Full nomad play viable.**
- **Performance is pillar 6**, with CI budget gates that fail the build.
- **Stack:** TypeScript + canvas + Vite, no engine, with a portability contract keeping a Godot pivot
  cheap. **Saves may break pre-1.0** — stable IDs and a version stamp, but no migration framework.
- **Vehicles were un-cut** after initially being cut at the vision level. `docs/00-vision.md` records
  the reversal and why the original objection was half right.
- **A district is 256 m, falloff stays linear.** Decided against re-authoring the magnitude table,
  because its ratios are load-bearing in six documents and only the unit was ever missing.
- **Field memory is scent, never noise.** Kept rather than cut, but on the condition that Milestone 1
  proves it does something.

## What the spike settled

The three findings are **folded into the documents that specify the systems**. Don't redo this; the
docs are the authority now and [`docs/23-roadmap.md`](docs/23-roadmap.md#spike-findings-attention-field)
keeps the evidence.

| Finding | What was decided | Now specified in |
|---|---|---|
| Gradient ascent alone makes **conga lines**, not a horde | Persistent per-individual angular bias (±0.62 rad), from the seeded RNG, in save state. No neighbour queries, no measurable cost. | [`docs/14`](docs/14-zombies.md#gradient-ascent-is-not-sufficient-on-its-own) |
| **Noise magnitudes aren't calibrated to district size** | The magnitudes were never wrong — the **unit** was never defined. 1 tile = 1 m, 0.7 attenuation per metre, 4 m field cells, **256 m district**, so one gunshot = one district. **Zero magnitudes changed.** | [`docs/03`](docs/03-attention.md#scale-and-calibration), [`docs/24`](docs/24-world-and-scale.md#how-big-a-district-is) |
| **Field memory is a no-op** | The spike tested it on the wrong channel. It's a **scent** mechanic in both specifying docs; residue-as-noise dies inside its own cell by arithmetic. Kept, on scent, with a Milestone 1 acceptance check that cuts it if nothing observable changes. | [`docs/03`](docs/03-attention.md#field-memory-is-a-scent-mechanic) |
| **Rendering dominates simulation** (~30×) | Draw budget and sim-share-of-frame budget added; every benchmark asserts frame time, not just tick time. | [`docs/22`](docs/22-performance.md#aim-the-budgets-at-the-renderer) |

Also worth keeping: **event-driven noise propagation is vindicated** — 6 live field cells when quiet.

## What Milestone 0 built, and the rules it made structural

The exit criterion is met and asserted (`test/integration/exit-criterion.test.ts`). More useful to a
newcomer than the file list is *which invariants are now enforced rather than merely intended*,
because these are the ones you will trip over:

- **`sim/` cannot touch the host.** Lint bans `Math.random`, `Date.now` and browser globals; on top of
  that `tsconfig.sim.json` compiles `sim/` with **no DOM lib**, so any DOM access is a type error, not
  a review comment. `step(world)` takes no time argument — the sim can't read a clock because it is
  never given one.
- **Iteration order is never left to chance.** Component queries sort by entity id, systems sort by
  `(phase, order, id)`, event handlers by `(order, id)`, modifiers fold by `(source, seq)`. Every one
  of those is guarding the same failure: registration order is module import order, and bundlers
  reorder that. Two of them are proven by mutation tests that fail when the sort is removed.
- **Content fails loudly at load.** Unknown stat, unimplemented behaviour tag, circular `extends`,
  duplicate id — all rejected before the first tick, all naming file, entry and field, and nothing is
  published unless everything validated.
- **Budgets fail the build.** `npm run bench` for tick, `npm run bench:frame` for draw. The frame one
  drives real Chromium, because frame time cannot be measured in node.
- **Any module can be switched off.** Checked in CI for each module individually and all at once.
  This is also how sandbox presets and storyteller settings get implemented later — not as special
  cases, as this.

## What the noise spine made structural

Four decisions that are cheap now and expensive to reverse later:

- **The field is kernel, not a module.** `docs/19` draws the line at "the tick loop, the entity store,
  the event bus, and the attention field", and so does the code: `world.field` exists in every world,
  including one booted with every module off. Decay and the `noise.emitted` subscription are also
  kernel — a module that can be switched off must not be what stops noise from fading.
- **Nothing writes to the field directly.** Emission is a published fact (`noise.emitted`) and the
  kernel is the only subscriber. A trap, a generator or a vehicle engine reaches the field by the same
  route as a footstep, and needs no knowledge that the field exists.
- **Input is drained once per tick, by the kernel.** It used to be the first system's job, which
  quietly made input single-consumer — the second module to ask got an empty list. The determinism
  test's negative control is what caught it.
- **The field is in the save, sparsely.** Live cells only. Watch for `-0`: `canonicalize` rejects it
  outright and a decaying float will reach it, so anything under the floor snaps to a hard zero.

## What Milestone 1 has found so far

- **Gradient ascent alone stops too early.** Noise decays with a 3 s half-life; the far half of a
  district is a minute's walk. Shamblers now carry a 20 s **travel commitment** — they keep their
  bearing after the gradient dies. Without it they forget mid-street, which reads as the field being
  broken rather than as noise fading. docs/03 already asked for this: *"the horde it already summoned
  is still walking."*
- **Decay shrinks loudness, not radius** — and this contradicted docs/03's prose, so
  [the doc was corrected](docs/03-attention.md#scale-and-calibration). Multiplying the stored field
  leaves its shape untouched: five half-lives after a shout every cell is 1/32 of what it was and the
  edge has barely moved. The resulting behaviour is the one the design wants, but by a different
  mechanism than "inaudible in 15 seconds" implies.
- **Converging is not a different cost class from drifting**, which is the property the new budgets
  guard. 0.19 ms against 0.15 at 300 bodies; 1.38 against 1.04 at 2,000.
- **One shout wakes essentially the whole district.** 4,055 of 4,096 cells. That is what the
  calibration says should happen — a shout carries 171 m across a 256 m district — but nobody had
  seen the consequence before now. Whether it makes shouting the only interesting verb is a
  playtest question, not an arithmetic one.

## Do this next

**Scent.** It is the next thing in `TODO.md` and it carries both remaining risks at once.

- **Scent is the risky part**, not noise. Noise is event-driven and measurably free; scent is the
  continuous channel [risk 5](docs/23-roadmap.md#risks) actually names, and it is still untested.
- **Field memory rides on scent** and has never been observed working, so the acceptance check is
  real: switch residue off, and if nothing observable changes, cut the mechanic.
- Doing both in one build is the point — [the roadmap says so](docs/23-roadmap.md#risks): *one build,
  two checkpoints.*

After that: light and shadowcasting, the spatial hash (deferred on purpose — gradient ascent needs no
neighbour queries), the melee loop, day/night, and the propagation budget with its overflow queue.

## Open questions nobody has answered

- **Is being quiet *tense*, or just slow?** Needs a human playing — and now there is a build to play.
  With noise as the only channel, quiet is *completely* safe: stand still and the field is literally
  zero live cells. That is the design as specified, and the strongest argument that scent isn't
  optional.
- **Does one shout being a district-wide event make shouting the only verb?** New, from watching it
  run. The magnitudes are right and the reach is what docs/03 calibrated for; the question is whether
  a stimulus that always recruits everybody leaves room for the quieter ones.
- **Scent cost.** Untested. It's the continuous channel [risk 5](docs/23-roadmap.md#risks) is actually
  about, so that risk is narrowed, not closed. It now carries a second question too: field memory has
  never been observed working, because it needs scent to exist first.
- **How long is a day, really?** Four hours at 1× is still a guess.
- The rest are listed under "Open questions" in [`docs/23-roadmap.md`](docs/23-roadmap.md).

*"How big is a district?" is no longer among them — it's 256 m, forced by the noise calibration.*

## Conventions and gotchas

- **Never put an em dash in a heading you intend to link to.** GitHub's anchor slugs collapse
  ` — ` into a double hyphen, and it has silently broken links three times in this repo. Use a colon.
  Several headings were rewritten for exactly this reason.
- **Every doc opens with "why this exists" and closes with a cut list.** The cut lists are load-bearing
  — they're what stops scope creep, and `TODO.md` restates them at the end for the same reason.
- **The README index is the reading order.** File numbers reflect authorship order.
- **The container is ephemeral.** Anything uncommitted is gone when the session ends.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` is git-ignored globally and won't travel with the repo.

## A habit worth continuing

Every guard added so far was **mutation-tested**: break the thing on purpose, confirm something goes
red, put it back. That is not ceremony — it caught two guards that looked rigorous and tested nothing:

- A modifier-ordering test using `0.1 / 0.2 / 0.3` passed with the fold sort deleted, because later
  multiplications rounded the difference away. Catastrophic cancellation fixed it.
- The frame budget passes with viewport culling removed, because 2,000 flat rectangles are cheap. It
  is a regression guard today, not proof that culling earns its place; it will bite when sprites
  replace rectangles. Recorded here so nobody reads it as stronger than it is.

The noise spine's three guards were each broken on purpose and confirmed red:

- Delete the angular bias → twenty shamblers in one cell collapse to a single heading.
- Delete the decay system → the district never falls silent.
- Delete the travel commitment → the horde forgets the moment the gradient dies.

One of those, the decay system, needed a **second** test written for it: the arithmetic was already
covered by a unit test calling `decay()` directly, which passed happily with the system unregistered.
Covering the maths is not covering the wiring.

A green suite says nothing about whether it *can* go red.
